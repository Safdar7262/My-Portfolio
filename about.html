                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm a final-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering, with a strong passion for web development and design. Throughout my academic journey, I've honed my skills in creating responsive, user-friendly websites that not only look great but also provide a seamless experience across all devices.</p>
                <p>My expertise lies in front-end development, where I enjoy turning creative ideas into functional and aesthetically pleasing websites. I'm also well-versed in back-end technologies, which allows me to build full-stack applications that are both robust and scalable.</p>
                <p>I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of web development. My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to build innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends, contributing to open-source projects, or working on personal projects to sharpen my skills.</p>
